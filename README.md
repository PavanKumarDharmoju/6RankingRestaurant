# 6RankingRestaurant
Project Description  The dataset is publically available.   
The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurant at different places.   
Also observing the effect of these factors on restaurant rating.   In short we want to find 1 to 5 rating of restaurant.    
So that customer can decide their preferences for restaurant.  
It contains total 51717 records and  17 features.  
Features includes  online_order, book_table, votes, rate ,location , rest_type, dish_type, â€¦ etc.  The Target variable is rate column.  
I have cleaned the data and applied algorithms to the model to make sure this model gives maximum accuracy.
